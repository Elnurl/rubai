# RubAI — AI Goal Coach

A mobile (Expo) AI-driven execution coach. Users describe ANY goal (custom or one of five templates: IELTS prep, programming, fitness, financial improvement, buying a car). RubAI then generates a tailored intake form, synthesises a structured `UserProfile`, builds a multi-phase roadmap, produces a fresh daily plan, and chats as an adaptive coach.

The app supports MULTIPLE concurrent goals. The number of active goals is gated by a (demo) subscription tier:
- **Free** — 1 goal
- **Pro** — 5 goals
- **Premium** — 25 goals

The subscription is stored locally with no real payments — users can switch tiers freely from the Account tab.

## Architecture

Monorepo (pnpm) with three artifacts:

- `artifacts/mobile` — Expo React Native app (the user-facing product). All persistence is client-side via AsyncStorage; no database.
- `artifacts/api-server` — Express server providing AI endpoints under `/api/atlas/*`. Calls OpenAI via `@workspace/integrations-openai-ai-server` (model `gpt-5.4` with `json_schema` structured outputs).
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox` — sandbox for design exploration (registered but unused in this product).

API contract lives in `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`; running `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` regenerates:
- `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/api.ts` — typed React Query hooks and TS types
- `lib/api-zod/src/generated/api.ts` — Zod schemas used by the server for validation

## API endpoints (all under `/api/atlas`)

- `POST /intake-questions` — given `goalType` + `goalTitle`, generates a tailored 5–8 question form.
- `POST /intake-submit` — given the answered questions, synthesises a structured `UserProfile`.
- `POST /roadmap` — given a `UserProfile`, returns a multi-phase `Roadmap` with milestones, strategy, and risk analysis.
- `POST /daily-plan` — given the profile + roadmap + behavioural snapshot, returns today's 3–5 tasks tuned to recent behaviour and the active phase.
- `POST /coach` — free-form coach chat with full plan + behavioural context.
- `POST /adapt` — runs the adaptive engine: returns `easier | same | harder` plus concrete adjustments.

The legacy `POST /onboarding-chat` endpoint is retained for backwards compatibility but no longer used by the app.

## Mobile app structure

Routes (expo-router):
- `app/_layout.tsx` — providers (QueryClient, AtlasProvider, KeyboardProvider, GestureHandler, SafeArea), font loading, splash control. Sets the API base URL via `setBaseUrl`.
- `app/index.tsx` — boot router; routes to `/welcome`, `/intake`, `/generating`, or `/(tabs)` based on `pendingDraft.stage` and whether any goals exist.
- `app/welcome.tsx` — first-run goal entry: free-text custom goal OR one of 5 templates.
- `app/new-goal.tsx` — same picker, used for adding additional goals when on Pro/Premium.
- `app/intake.tsx` — renders the AI-generated intake form. Calls `intake-questions` then `intake-submit`.
- `app/generating.tsx` — animated roadmap loader. Calls `createGoal(profile)` (which returns the new `Goal`) then `setRoadmapForGoal(newGoal.id, roadmap)`. Recovers the synthesised profile from `pendingDraft.synthesizedProfile` if route params are missing.
- `app/(tabs)` — main app: **5 tabs** — Today / Roadmap / Coach / Goals / Account. Native tabs on iOS via `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs` when liquid glass is available; classic blurred tabs otherwise.

State lives in `providers/AtlasProvider.tsx` and is persisted to AsyncStorage with the `atlas:v2:` prefix. The provider keeps a list of `Goal`s plus an `activeGoalId`; tab screens read from `active*` accessors (`activeRoadmap`, `activeProfile`, `activeDailyPlan`, etc.). When the active goal changes, all tab screens automatically reflect the new context.

The provider uses **refs** (`goalsRef`, `activeIdRef`, `subscriptionRef`) alongside React state so chained async callbacks always see the latest values — this prevents stale-closure bugs when, e.g., creating a goal and immediately attaching a roadmap.

The `BehavioralSnapshot` (streak, completion rate, recent completed/missed task titles) is computed per-active-goal from local task history.

### Storage migration

On first load, the provider reads any pre-existing `atlas:v1:*` keys (the legacy single-goal layout) and migrates them into the new `atlas:v2:goals` array as a single goal with active focus. A `migrated` flag is set so the migration only runs once.

### Subscription gating

Enforced in two places (defence-in-depth):
- UI: `(tabs)/goals.tsx` and `welcome.tsx` / `new-goal.tsx` check `canAddMoreGoals` and disable the entry point when the limit is reached.
- Provider: `createGoal` throws a `GoalLimitError` if the current goal count already equals the tier limit.

## Theme

Warm cream + emerald + amber palette; Inter for typography. `constants/colors.ts` defines `light` and `dark` palettes consumed via `hooks/useColors.ts`. No emojis anywhere; iconography via `@expo/vector-icons` and SF Symbols (iOS).

## Environment

- `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY` — wired via the OpenAI integration; do not handle directly.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` — provided by Expo workflow; used by the mobile bundle to call the API.

## Key files

- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/atlas.ts` — all Atlas endpoints (structured outputs).
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/index.ts` — mounts the atlas router at `/atlas`.
- `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` — single source of truth for the API contract.
- `artifacts/mobile/providers/AtlasProvider.tsx` — multi-goal state + persistence + ref-based callbacks.
- `artifacts/mobile/types/atlas.ts` — `Goal`, `Subscription`, `IntakeDraft`, `TIER_INFO` and helpers.
- `artifacts/mobile/constants/atlas.ts` — goal-template metadata (label, tagline, icon, default titles).
- `artifacts/mobile/lib/storage.ts` — AsyncStorage helpers, v2 keys, and v1 migration reader.
- `artifacts/mobile/components/IntakeForm.tsx` — renders the AI-generated questions with validation.
- `artifacts/mobile/components/SubscriptionCard.tsx` — shows current tier, usage bar, and tier switcher.
- `artifacts/mobile/components/GoalListItem.tsx` — row in the Goals tab with active/switch/delete actions.
- `artifacts/mobile/components/ActiveGoalChip.tsx` — header chip showing which goal a tab is currently viewing.
